## Objectives
In this stage, you should write a program that:

1. Parses the command line and gets two arguments that are IP address and port.
2. Tries different passwords until it finds the correct one.
3. Prints the password it found.

Note that you can connect to the server only once and then send messages many times. Don't connect to the server before sending every message.

Also, note that here and throughout the project, the password is different every time you check your code.
